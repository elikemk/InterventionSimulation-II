This example scene requires Valve's SteamVR plugin:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647

It uses VR interaction elements copied from the SteamVR plugin's
InteractionSystem Samples scene. If you're familiar with the way the Samples
scene works, then this example will be familiar.

- You can teleport to a position in front of Private Hart.

- Touch Private Hart and pull a controller trigger to start the conversation.

- A world space dialogue UI will appear to Hart's left. Touch a response 
button and pull a controller trigger to select a response. Since this example
uses the Dialogue System's Demo conversation, it only offers one response in
each menu, but your own conversations can offer more responses of course.

Exported from Unity 2018.3.0f2.
